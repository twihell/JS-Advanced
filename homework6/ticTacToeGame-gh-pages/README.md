# ticTacToeGame-gh-pages

This is another one-page project I made as an assignment at ITEA school. The aim was to create a Tic Tac Toe game, providing
it with the original game logic by using JavaScript. The game styling was provided by the teacher so that we could concentrate
specifically on the coding part. 

This realization of TicTacToe is a single-player game where every odd move equals an 'X' move and every even move equals an
'O' move. On loading the page, you can see a playing field consising of 9 cells. As in the original game, you can just click on 
any cell thus making the first move. If you put three 'X's horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the message will appear on top
of the page, stating that the 'X' player has won the game. The same goes to getting three 'O's in the same way. If you get a
win-win situation, the message on top of the page states 'It is draw!'. If you want to replay the game, click on the 'Reset Game'
button.
