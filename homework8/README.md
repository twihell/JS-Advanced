This is a mini-project dedicated to practicing HTTP requests in JavaScript. Here, I accessed GitHub user API to be able to retrieve
information about its users (their bio, avatar, and followers list). On the client side, there is a search field where you
can enter the user's nickname and press the "Get User" button. After the server sends the response, the data is shown in its 
correspnding locations on the page, pre-determined by using HTML and CSS. The page shows:
- the user's name and avatar;
- their bio (if available);
- their first 5 followers;
- and the (5) followers of their first and fifth immidiate followers.
